# Initial search for potential TEAM LEADERS
## Data Required
- List of companies from [SAM.gov](https://www.sam.gov/SAM/pages/public/searchRecords/advancedEMRSearch.jsf) that meet the following:
  - Small Business
  - NAICS code: 541512
  - United States
- List of companies with CMMI ML2 and up
  - I can reference my original list from Factor 1 [SAM_CMMI.xlsx](https://github.com/ericaosta/alagant/blob/main/F1/SAM_CMMI.xlsx) and include CMMI ML2 and up
  - I can begin my search agnostic of CMMI status and, after narrowing down based on Small Business, NAICS, Clearances, etc., I can manually check for CMMI and ISO
- List of awards from [USAspending.gov](https://www.usaspending.gov); search under AWARD DESCRIPTION
  - Facility Security Clearance ("TOP SECRET", "SECURITY CLEARANCE", etc.)
  - Cost Accounting System
  - Approved Purchasing System
- Others? Esp. to find FCL. To instance, [state.gov](https://www.state.gov/facility-security-clearances-faq/) states that FCL can be in the form of a formal contract, Request for Proposal (RFP), purchase order, an IDIQ. There is some more info on this discussion on [business.defense.gov](https://business.defense.gov/Portals/57/Documents/SmallBusinessWebinar%20QandA.pdf?ver=2020-07-15-161110-867) but do not know how to appropriately and thoroughly proceed on this item yet.
